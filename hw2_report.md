# Question 1 

The below graph shows the box plot for each state showing the distribution of percentage of people with a professional education. The graph depicts that WI has the lowest median of people with a professional education while IN has the highest. The spread is roughly the same amongst the states with the interquartile range being the same. We can hypothesizes that the counties with the highest percentage are cities where large cooperation's or colleges are located. 
The states that have the most outlying counties are MI and IL.  MI stands out with a county that has around 21% of people with professional degrees. 

The state with the highest percentage of population with a professional education is IN with a mean of 5.05%

The lowest is WI with a mean of 4.04%

The above was computed by taking the mean for every county within the state on the % of people with a professional degree.

Can you point out which state has the lowest and highest percentage of population with a professional education? If not, explain why. You may interpret this in one of two ways: A) compute a summary statistic for each state (e.g. combined mean) and compare that across states; or, B) directly compare the percprof distributions across states. Support your claim with additional statistics/graph(s) here, if necessary.

# Question 2
Below is the GGPAIRS plot showing the relationship between perchsd vs. state, percollege vs. state, perchsd vs. percollege

**Observation 1** In the bottom left quadrant displaying PRECHSD vs PRECOLLEGE there is an interesting observation that can be made, There is a positive relation ship between a county having a % of people having a high school degree and college degree. This makes intuitive sense that counties that have a higher percentage of a high school diploma have a higher percentage of college degrees. This is because people need a high school diploma before they can even attend college. Looking at this further a graph was created to show the relationship with a trend line demonstrating the relationship between Perchsd and percollege

**Observation 2** Looking at the box plot of state vs precollege there are lot more outliers of counties that have a high percentage of people with college degrees. While on the other hand sate vs perchsd there are fewer outliers. This could be attributed to the fact that public education is mandated while college is voluntary and expensive

## Question 3
Describe the different elements of a Box Plot and how they illustrate different statistical properties of a sample. Show a Box Plot diagram with these elements labeled (need not be based on actual data).

**Box Plot**

**Max** is the largest value in the dataset 

**Min** is the lowest value in the dataset. 

**Median** is the middle point where the top half  is where 50% of the data resides and the bottom half is where 50% of the data resides.  

**1st quartile** is where 25% of the data falls below this point. 

**3rd quartile** refers to 75% of the data falls below this point. 

**IQR Inter Quartile Range** is where 50% of the data resides. 

**The whiskers** of the plot refers to data that falls out of the middle 50%
 
When would you use a Box Plot, a Histogram, vs. a QQPlot to graphically summarize data? Describe the primary purpose and mention 1 example use case for each type of plot.

Box Plot - Box plots help to visualize how spread out the data is. It can also demonstrate outliers. 
Example case could be to view the outliers of counties with higher % professsional degrees.

Histogram - Shows the distribution of the data. It displays if a dataset is normally distributed or skewed to a partiular side. 
Example use case can see how the distribution of diamond prices are in a dataset. One can determine if they are normally distributed or skewed.

QQPlot- Is used to compare two datasets to see how related they are and if they have similar distributions. It can also help determine the tail behavior.  If two data sets have the same distribution then it will fall along the y=x line. 
Example use case can help determine if data on counties and their % of people with college degrees came from a similar distribution for two different states.

## Question 4
 
 The 1,000 data point scatter plot shows very sparse data with a lot of empty white space. While the 10,000 data point scatter plot has more data points and displays less white space. There is also more information and detail needed to create the 10,000 point graph.

The PDF and PS file types show a  linear increase in file size when N increases. The PS file time has a steeper slope than PDF. The PDF file type grows the lowest in size. JPEG and PNG demonstrate a logarithmic increase when N gets bigger.  When N gets to 5000 JPEG  has a larger file size than PNG however when N is lower than 5000  JPEG and PNG have similar file size. The JPEG file type has the biggest file size compared to the other file types.

## Question 5

The distribution of the color of diamonds is semi normal. With the lower frequency of diamonds being  color i-j, which are low quality. While there is also a low frequency of D which is the highest of quality.

The distribution of diamond carat is right tail skewed there is a higher frequency of diamonds that are lower carat. It can be inferred that higher carat diamonds are larger and more rare.

The distribution of diamond price is heavily right tail skewed where the higher frequencies occur at a lower price. This can be attributed to the fact that higher priced diamonds are more rare.

Below is the pariwise plot for the diamonds data set comparing color, carat and price. There is a positive exponential relationship between carat and price. I wanted to investigate further and plotted carat vs price and colored each data point depending on the color ranking of the diamond. This allowed to determine how color affected price for each carat size. It is interesting to see that the higher quality color D and E have a higher price for the same carat size compared to other colors. What is also interesting is that there is a lower frequency of higher quality colored diamonds at larger carat sizes. Most of the higher quality color diamonds are at lower carats indicating that it might be more rare to have both a large and flawless diamond.
