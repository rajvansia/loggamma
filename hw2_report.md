# Question 1 

The below graph shows the box plot for each state showing the distribution of percentage of people with a professional education. The graph depicts that OH has the lowest median of people with a professional education while IN has the highest. The spread is roughly the same amongst the states with the interquartile range being the same. We can hypothesizes that the counties with the highest percentage are cities where large cooperation's or colleges are located. 
The states that have the most outlying counties are MI and IL.  MI stands out with a county that has around 21% of people with professional degrees. 

# Question 2
Below is the GGPAIRS plot showing the relationship between perchsd vs. state, percollege vs. state, perchsd vs. percollege
 

**Observation 1** In the bottom left quadrant displaying PRECHSD vs PRECOLLEGE there is an interesting observation that can be made, There is a positive relation ship between a county having a % of people having a high school degree and college degree. This makes intuitive sense that counties that have a higher percentage of a high school diploma have a higher percentage of college degrees. This is because people need a high school diploma before they can even attend college. Looking at this further a graph was created to show the relationship with a trend line demonstrating the relationship between Perchsd and percollege

**Observation 2** Looking at the box plot of state vs precollege there are lot more outliers of counties that have a high percentage of people with college degrees. While on the other hand sate vs perchsd there are fewer outliers. This could be attributed to the fact that public education is mandated while college is voluntary and expensive

## Question 3
Describe the different elements of a Box Plot and how they illustrate different statistical properties of a sample. Show a Box Plot diagram with these elements labeled (need not be based on actual data).

**Box Plot** 

**Max** is the largest value in the dataset 

**Min** is the lowest value in the dataset. 

**Median** is the middle point where the top half  is where 50% of the data resides and the bottom half is where 50% of the data resides.  

**1st quartile** is where 25% of the data falls below this point. 

**3rd quartile** refers to 75% of the data falls below this point. 

**IQR Inter Quartile Range** is where 50% of the data resides. 

**The whiskers** of the plot refers to data that falls out of the middle 50%
 
When would you use a Box Plot, a Histogram, vs. a QQPlot to graphically summarize data? Describe the primary purpose and mention 1 example use case for each type of plot.

Box Plot - Box plots help to visualize how spread out the data is. It can also demonstrate outliers. 
Example
  
Histogram - Shows the distribution of the data. It displays if a dataset is normally distributed or skewed to a partiular side. 
Example
  
QQPlot- Is used to compare two datasets to see how related they are and if they have similar distributions. It can also help determine the tail behavior.  If two data sets have the same distribution then it will fall along the y=x line.
